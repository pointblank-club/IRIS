Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for Structure-Aware LLVM IR Analysis 

  Objective: Enhance the IRis optimization pipeline by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the structural and
  semantic relationships within LLVM IR, overcoming the limitations of static scalar feature vectors.

  Problem Statement:
  Currently, IRis relies on static scalar metrics (e.g., instruction counts, loop depths) to represent programs. This approach
  discards critical structural information such as control flow (branching logic) and data dependencies (def-use chains).
  Consequently, structurally distinct programs may yield identical feature vectors, potentially confusing the predictive model and
  limiting optimization performance.

  Expected Outcomes (Enhancements):

   * Graph-Based Feature Extraction: Develop a robust pipeline to parse LLVM IR (.ll files) and construct representative graphs.
       * Nodes: Represent Basic Blocks or individual instructions with embedded type information.
       * Edges: Capture Control Flow Graph (CFG) connections and Data Flow Graph (DFG) dependencies.
   * GNN Architecture Integration: Architect and integrate a GNN Encoder (using PyTorch Geometric or DGL) into the existing
     PassFormer model.
       * The encoder will process program graphs to generate structure-aware embedding vectors.
       * These embeddings will serve as rich inputs for the Transformer Decoder to predict optimal pass sequences.
   * Performance Benchmarking: Train and evaluate the GNN-enhanced model against the existing scalar-based baseline.
       * Demonstrate improved generalization on unseen programs.
       * Validate superior optimization metrics (execution time/binary size reduction) on the RISC-V target.

  Required Skills: Python, PyTorch (Deep Learning), Graph Neural Networks (PyTorch Geometric/DGL), Compiler Theory (LLVM IR
  structure).

  Expected Size: 350 hours

  Difficulty: Medium-Hard

  Complexity: High. Requires bridging the gap between compiler infrastructure (LLVM IR analysis) and advanced deep learning (Graph
  Representation Learning). This project moves IRis from statistical machine learning to structure-aware deep learning.
