IRis: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for Structure-Aware LLVM IR Analysis

Summary

Enhance the IRis optimization pipeline by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the structural and semantic relationships within LLVM IR, overcoming the limitations of static scalar feature vectors.

Currently, IRis relies on static scalar metrics, which discards critical structural information like control flow and data dependencies. This project addresses this by developing a pipeline to construct representative graphs from LLVM IR. A GNN Encoder will be integrated into the existing PassFormer model to generate structure-aware embeddings for predicting optimal pass sequences. The new model will be benchmarked to validate improved optimization metrics and generalization on the RISC-V target.
